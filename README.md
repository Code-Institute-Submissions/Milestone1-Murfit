Murfit: Personal Training

User Centric FrontEnd Development Milestone Project – Coe Institute

This is a website for a fitness personal trainer. It showcases who the personal trainer is, their story and why others should join her gym and get involved in fitness.

UX:

The website is aimed at those interested in the fitness industry or want to get involved but haven’t made that step yet.
The websites purpose is to get those users that are interested to sign up to the Murfit gym.
The design is aimed at making those users who are taking their first steps into the fitness industry feel comfortable by showcasing how simple it is to just get moving.
The colours are consistent with the Murfit gym, using black and orange helps it to really stand out and engage the user.


Features:

Navbar – The Navbar features the business name very purposely so the user is aware of the brand. It also allows the user to navigate easily to their desired location. On smaller screens the navbar collapses to a very tidy button.

Home page – this features a Jumbotron image which has 100% viewport height. On the image is a tag line with a call to action button to sign up. The button brings them to the contact page 

My Journey Page – summary of who the personal trainer is with an image of them working out as well as the journey they have taken to get to this stage. 

Murfit Page – Summary of why the user should sign up and why they should not wait, all aimed at motivating the user on their fitness journey

Contact Page – user has the ability to fill out a small form, with their name, email and their fitness goals. This provides the user an end goal for the website as the website has achieved what it set out to do

Footer – footer has links to social media pages, giving the user more opportunity to learn about the gym and the methods used.
